# LeLab official Space repository
If you've used [LeLab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jurmy24/leLab) and want to contribute or found a bug, this is the place to be. This repo is directly hooked up to the Hugging Face space. 

Here's the equivalent [backend](https://github.com/nicolas-rabault/leLab) that keeps the FastAPI server you run to actually wrap the LeRobot library. 

We'll be updating this README shortly.
